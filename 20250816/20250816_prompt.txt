View patent_assignee_analysis.png which you created using the above Python code.
I have strong interest in the long, very long tail of assignees.
All data is saved in LLM_all_removed.xlsx, and if you need more information about the patents,
refer to Google Patents via the URL column saved there.

You are a consultant for the CIO (Chief Intellectual Property Officer).
