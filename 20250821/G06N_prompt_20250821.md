## Python Code Templates

### Basic Data Loading
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter

df = pd.read_excel('G06N_all.xlsx')
df['year'] = pd.to_datetime(df['issued'], errors='coerce').dt.year
df = df[(df['year'] >= 2014) & (df['year'] <= 2024)].copy()
```

### Technology Analysis
```python
tech_counts = {}
for tech in ['machine learning', 'neural', 'deep learning']:
    count = df['abstract'].str.lower().str.contains(tech, na=False).sum()
    tech_counts[tech] = count
```

### Growth Analysis
```python
yearly_counts = df['year'].value_counts().sort_index()
for year in range(2015, 2025):
    if year in yearly_counts.index and (year-1) in yearly_counts.index:
        growth = ((yearly_counts[year] - yearly_counts[year-1]) / yearly_counts[year-1]) * 100
        print(f'{year}: {growth:.1f}% growth')
```
